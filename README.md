# smoothSDE

The R package smoothSDE implements varying-coefficient stochastic differential equations, as described in this preprint:

Michelot, T., Glennie, R., Harris, C., Thomas, L. (2020)  
["Varying-coefficient stochastic differential equations with applications in ecology"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09111)  
_arXiv preprint_, arXiv:2008.09111.

It can be installed from Github using devtools:
``` R
devtools::install_github("TheoMichelot/smoothSDE")
```

To get started, have a look at [the vignette](https://github.com/TheoMichelot/smoothSDE/blob/master/vignettes/smoothSDE.rmd). It includes example code for the analysis of an elephant movement data set. More will be added soon!
