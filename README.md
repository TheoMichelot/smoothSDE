# smoothSDE

The R package smoothSDE implements varying-coefficient stochastic differential equations, as described in this paper:

_Journal of Agricultural, Biological, and Environmental Statistics_. DOI: 10.1007/s13253-021-00450-6.

It can be installed from Github using devtools:
``` R
devtools::install_github("TheoMichelot/smoothSDE")
```

To get started, have a look at [the vignette](https://github.com/TheoMichelot/smoothSDE/raw/master/vignettes/smoothSDE.pdf). It includes example code for the analysis of an elephant movement data set. More will be added soon!
